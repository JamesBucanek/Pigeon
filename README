Homer the Pigeon

========================================

Homer the Pigeon is an iOS app for Apple's iPhone series of devices.

It's purpose is simple: it remembers where you were and helps you get back there again.
So when you park, step out of the subway, or before you leave your hotel lobby,
open Homer, tap the (+) button, and you'll never have to worry about how to
get back.

While writing the "Pigeon" app in chapter 17 of "Learn iOS 7 App Development"
(available from Apress Publishing http://www.learniosappdev.com/), I was inspired
to create a commercial quality version of the same app.

I also decided to make the source for the entire app freely available, both
as a bonus for those who've worked through the book, and as an aid in helping
budding iOS app developers get started.

Homer the Pigeon also incorporates lessons from chapters 7, 11, 12, 18, 19, and 24.

I welcome feedback at james@learniosappdev.com
