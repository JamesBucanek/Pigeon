Homing Pigeon

========================================

Homing Pigeon is an iOS app for Apple's iPhone series of device.

It's purporse is simple: It remembers where you were and helps you get back there again.
So when you park, step out of the subway, or before you leave your hotel lobby,
open Pigeon, tap the (+) button, and you'll never have to worry about how to
get back.

While writing the "Pigeon" app in chapter 17 of "Learn iOS 7 App Development,"
available from Apress (http://www.learniosappdev.com/), I was inspired to create
a comercial quality version of the same app.

I also decided to make the source for the entire app freely availble, both
as an bonus for those who've worked through the book, and as an aid in helping
budding iOS app developers get started.

Homing Pigeon incorporates lessons from chapters 7, 11, 12, 18, 19, and 24.

I welcome feedback at james@learniosappdev.com
